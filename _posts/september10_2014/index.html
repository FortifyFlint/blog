                Well today was Git and GitHub. It was a little hard to grasp at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is not all that bad. I've learned that repetition is key. I try and think of it as constantly saving any design file I'm working on, and that really helps.<br></br>
                We're also finally getting into html layout and css, awesome! I am the king of copying and pasting code from all over the web, and to date my sites have ben <em>okay</em>. However, I have always wanted to really understnad what I've been doing. So that I'm not contantly having to worry that my websites are held together by bubble-gum and duct tape. So again, I'm pumped! And am really looking forward to getting started in on the homework. I have visions of grandure, but already know that I need to limit myself visually, so that I can trully grasp the fundamentals.
