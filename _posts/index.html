            	What a day this was! A little nerve-wracking walking into class wandering if I would be able to handle this. I love to design but have put off learning to really code for such a long time. Class seems legit and teacher sounds like she really knows her stuff. I'm pumped!

            	Well today was Git and GitHub. It was a little hard to grasp at first, but once you get the hange of it, it is not all that bad. I've learned that repetition is key. I try and think of it as constantly saving any design file I'm working on, and that really helps.
